      <hr class="my-4 h-[3px] w-80 border-none bg-primary" />
      <p class="pb-5">
        A scammer is an individual or entity that engages in fraudulent activities to deceive and exploit others for financial 
        gain or personal advantage. Scammers often employ various deceptive tactics, such as false promises,
        misinformation, or manipulation, to trick their victims into providing sensitive information, money, or valuable
        assets. They operate in different forms, including online scams, phone scams, email scams, and more. The primary
        goal of a scammer is to deceive and defraud others, leading to financial loss or other negative consequences for
        the victims. It’s essential to be cautious and vigilant to avoid falling victim to scams.

          <Icon name="mdi:dots-circle" class="inline" />
          <strong>Phishing Scams</strong>
          <p class="ml-5">Scammers send deceptive emails or messages that appear to be from reputable organizations, 
          such as banks or online services. They aim to trick recipients into providing personal information like 
          passwords, credit card details, or login credentials.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-4">
          <Icon name="mdi:dots-circle" class="inline" />
          <strong>Tech Support Scams</strong>
          <p class="ml-5">Scammers pretend to be tech support representatives from well-known companies and contact 
          individuals claiming that their computer has a virus or technical issue. They offer to “help” by gaining 
          access to the victim’s computer and may charge fees for unnecessary services or steal sensitive data.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-4">
          <Icon name="mdi:dots-circle" class="inline" />
          <strong>Online Purchase Scams</strong>
          <p class="ml-5">Scammers set up fake online stores or auction listings to sell products that either don’t exist 
            or are significantly different from what is advertised. Victims pay for the items but never receive them.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-4">
          <Icon name="mdi:dots-circle" class="inline" />
          <strong>Nigerian Prince Scams</strong>
          <p class="ml-5">This is a type of advance-fee scam where the scammer claims to be a wealthy individual, often a 
          Nigerian prince, and offers to share their fortune with the victim. However, the victim needs to pay various 
          fees or expenses upfront, which ultimately leads to financial loss.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-4">
          <Icon name="mdi:dots-circle" class="inline" />
          <strong>Lottery or Prize Scams</strong>
          <p class="ml-5">Scammers inform victims that they have won a lottery or prize and ask for payment to cover taxes 
          or processing fees before the winnings can be claimed. In reality, there is no prize, and the victim loses the 
          money sent to the scammer.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-4">
          <Icon name="mdi:dots-circle" class="inline" />
          <strong>Romance Scams (pig butchering)</strong>
          <p class="ml-5">Scammers create fake online dating profiles and form romantic
          relationships with victims. Once trust is established, they request money for various reasons, such as medical
          emergencies or travel expenses, but it’s all a ploy to extract money from the victim.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-4">
          <Icon name="mdi:dots-circle" class="inline" />
          <strong>Investment Scams</strong>
          <p class="ml-5">Scammers offer fake investment opportunities promising high returns with
          little or no risk. Unsuspecting individuals invest money, but the scammer either disappears with the funds or
          provides false updates until the scheme collapses.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-4">
          <Icon name="mdi:dots-circle" class="inline" />
          <strong>IRS Impersonation Scams</strong>
          <p class="ml-5">Scammers impersonate IRS agents and contact individuals, claiming they
          owe back taxes and must make immediate payments to avoid legal consequences. They use fear and urgency to
          pressure victims into sending money.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        These are just a few examples of the many scams that exist. It’s crucial to stay informed and vigilant to protect

        <h2 class="font-heading text-3xl">What Are Scam Baiters?</h2>
        <hr class="my-4 h-[3px] w-96 border-none bg-accent" />
        <p>
          A scam baiter is an individual who actively engages
          with scammers and online fraudsters with the intention of wasting their time, gathering information about their
          operations, raising awareness, and even getting call centers shut down. Scam baiters typically pose as potential victims, using fake
          personas.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Their primary objective is to prevent scammers from targeting real victims and potentially causing financial or
          emotional harm. By engaging with scammers and leading them on, baiters disrupt their operations, making it more
          difficult for them to find actual victims and reducing their effectiveness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It’s important to note that scam baiting carries certain risks, and it should be done with caution. Engaging
          with scammers can lead to potential retaliation or even more harrasment. Individuals interested in scam
          baiting should take appropriate precautions and avoid revealing any personal information during the
          interactions. If you are curious and want to watch how some of these baiters work check out the videos below from
